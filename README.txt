This program is a small android app that allows the user to create, edit, delete, and save notes stored in a non-relational database.

This program was creating in python to test and learn using python. It also uses google app engine for its backend, using googles NDB database.

This project was also used to further my knowledge of creating android apps, and how to send, and and retrieve data using GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT requests.

This server is not currently up and running.
